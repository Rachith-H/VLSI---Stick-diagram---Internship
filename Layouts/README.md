#  Layout Images (No Grid)

This folder contains layout images of various CMOS logic circuits created using **Magic VLSI**. These layouts were developed based on corresponding stick diagrams and represent the physical implementation of each circuit at the transistor level.

The images are layouts without grids for cleaner visualization and presentation purposes. They were used in documentation and reporting to illustrate the final layout after design and extraction.

### Layouts Included:
- Inverter
- NAND (2-input, 3-input)
- NOR (2-input, 3-input)
- AND (2-input, 3-input)
- OR (2-input, 3-input)
- XOR, XNOR
- Half Adder
- 3-Stage Ring Oscillator

All layouts were implemented using the **SCMOS design rules** for educational purposes only and are not intended for fabrication.
