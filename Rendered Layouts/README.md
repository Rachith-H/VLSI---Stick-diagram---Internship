#  Rendered Layout Images

This folder contains high-quality **rendered layout images** of various CMOS logic circuits, captured using the 3D display and rendering features in **Magic VLSI**. These images are intended for documentation and presentation purposes, offering a cleaner and more visually understandable view of the layout without grid clutter.

The rendered layouts were created after completing design and extraction, and they correspond to circuits whose logical behavior was verified using Ngspice simulations.

### Circuits Included:
- Inverter
- NAND (2-input, 3-input)
- NOR (2-input, 3-input)
- AND (2-input, 3-input)
- OR (2-input, 3-input)
- XOR, XNOR
- Half Adder
- 3-Stage Ring Oscillator

All layouts were developed using **Magic VLSI** following the **SCMOS design rules**, and are for academic and self-learning purposes only.

> These rendered views are useful for illustrating the final physical design in reports, without focusing on grid or layer alignment details.
