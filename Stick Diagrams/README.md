#  Stick Diagrams

This folder contains the **stick diagrams** drawn for various CMOS logic circuits as part of a VLSI design internship. Stick diagrams are simplified representations of the physical layout, using color-coded lines to indicate different fabrication layers like polysilicon, diffusion, and metal.

These diagrams were used as a reference to implement layouts in Magic VLSI and help visualize the structure of each circuit before layout design.

### Circuits Included:
- Inverter
- NAND (2-input, 3-input)
- NOR (2-input, 3-input)
- AND (2-input, 3-input)
- OR (2-input, 3-input)
- XOR, XNOR
- Half Adder
- 3-Stage Ring Oscillator

All diagrams follow the standard CMOS color convention used for educational purposes.
