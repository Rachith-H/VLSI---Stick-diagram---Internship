#  Layout Images (With Grid)

This folder contains layout screenshots of various CMOS logic circuits designed using **Magic VLSI**, with the **layout grid enabled**. The grid provides a visual reference for alignment, spacing, and layer positioning, which is useful during manual layout design and review.

These images were captured during the layout phase to demonstrate design rule alignment and transistor placement with respect to the grid.

### Layouts Included:
- Inverter
- NAND (2-input, 3-input)
- NOR (2-input, 3-input)
- AND (2-input, 3-input)
- OR (2-input, 3-input)
- XOR, XNOR
- Half Adder
- 3-Stage Ring Oscillator

All layouts were created using **Magic VLSI** under the **SCMOS technology** for learning and educational use. These grid-enabled images are helpful for understanding transistor placement and routing discipline in physical design.
