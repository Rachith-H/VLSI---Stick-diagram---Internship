# Internship on VLSI Stick Diagrams & Layout Simulation

This repository contains all the work carried out during a self-learning internship focused on understanding the basics of **VLSI design using stick diagrams, layout implementation, and SPICE simulation**.

### üìò About the Internship
The internship aimed to develop hands-on skills in custom layout design using open-source tools. It involved learning the concept of **stick diagrams**, translating them into transistor-level **layouts using Magic VLSI**, extracting **SPICE netlists**, and verifying circuit behavior using **Ngspice** simulations. The design flow followed **SCMOS rules** and was carried out in a **Linux (Ubuntu)** environment.
